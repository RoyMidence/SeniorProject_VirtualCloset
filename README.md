# SeniorProject_VirtualCloset

  Assignment for Senior Project class. Goal is to come together as a team and tackle a project using the Agile Methodology.
While the final product isn't perfect the goal was achieved. We Successfully completed most sprint goals, handled documnentation fairly well,
and ended the project with an app that didn't turn our phones into IED's so thats a plus. Humor aside, while the quality of the programming is poor the team 
should still be proud of the work considering our circumstances.

  The app itself runs on an SQLite database on the phone. While this was not the original goal, it was the best result we could produce at the time with our knowledge.
The whole point of the app is to virtualy store a users clothing, allowing them to better manage their available outfits and to even help pick an outfit for them. 
The app should be able to add, edit and remove clothing. Add, edit and remove entire outfits. Pick an outfit or clothing based on user preferences and weather.
A user should be able to create an acccount, set preferences such as what weather they consider hot or cold, and share their closets with other users. 
In regards to the user based functinons, because the app stores all its data locally some of the features were more or less pretend features. So yes the user can
create an account and share their closet but they can't use another phone to sign in or share their closet with a differnt phone. It's all on one phone.
As said earlier, the original goal was to use a live database like Firebase but no group member had the confidence or knowledge to do so successfuly. We did what we 
could to produce results that passed. It was a lot of effort and a lot of on the spot learning. But it was a fun and valuable experince that, hopefuly, we all learned 
from.

  Most features should work, weather system is no longer functional because we used the API too many times. When you open the app it should ask you to create an 
 account. Once that is done you should open up the closet portion of the app to get it to fill with data. After that, feel free to explore and mess around.
